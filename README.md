Project Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains the code for various projects I have worked on. Below is a brief description of each project included in this repository.
Projects

Project 1: Image Processing Filters

    Description: Implements edge detection and median filtering techniques to process images. Uses parallel processing with OpenCL for performance optimization.
    Languages: C, C++, Python


Project 2: JavaScript Projects

    Description: Contains three JavaScript projects:
        About Us Landing Page: A dynamic landing page for a company.
        Rock Paper Scissors Game: An interactive game with real-time feedback.
        Counter Application: A simple counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities.
    Languages: JavaScript, CSS, HTML


Project 3: Load Balancing Algorithm for 5G Networks

    Description: Developed a load balancing algorithm for a 5G network integrating LEO satellites and ground networks. Utilizes fuzzy logic for optimizing resource distribution.
    Language: Python


Project 4: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for Pathfinding

    Description: Created a DAG data structure to determine the shortest path for various applications including transport systems, network routing, and neural network representation. Implements Dijkstraâ€™s, BFS, and Bellman-Ford algorithms.
    Language: Java 
    

Project 5: Wireless Bird Weighing System

    Description: Collaborated on a project to build a wireless scale that logs bird weights automatically. Uses strain gauges, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Zero W for data processing and storage.
    Languages: C++, Python

Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, follow the instructions below for each project:
Setup Instructions

    Clone the Repository:
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-directory]

    Project-Specific Setup:
        Project 1: Ensure you have OpenCL installed. Compile and run the C++ and Python files as needed.
        Project 2: Open the HTML files in a web browser. Ensure you have a text editor for JavaScript and CSS files.
        Project 3: Install Python dependencies using pip install -r and run the Python scripts.
        Project 4: Compile the Java files using javac *.java and run the main class using java Graph.
        Project 5: Install necessary libraries for ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, upload code to the ESP32, and configure MariaDB on the Raspberry Pi.
